## 👋 Hi and Welcome

I’m currently a **Support Director** at a medium-sized **MSP in Central Florida**. What began as a strong focus on **Network Engineering** has grown into a passion for understanding modern **cloud platforms** and how they’re built, operated, and scaled.

My current goal is to deepen my cloud knowledge and grow into a **DevOps / Site Reliability Engineering** role.

If you're interested in the **MSP landscape** or curious about what it is like getting started in an **IT / Helpdesk** role, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-koscoe).
