## 👋 Hi and Welcome

I'm am currently a **Support Director** at a medium-sized **MSP in Central Florida**. What started as a heavy focus on **Network Engineering** has evolved into a strong interest in understanding what it takes to work in the Cloud. My current goals are to better understand the cloud platforms and grow into a **Dev Ops / Site Realiability** Role.

If you're interested in the **MSP landscape** or curious about what is is like getting started in an **IT / Helpdesk** role, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-koscoe).
